  poems:
  - I lvoe you
  - 'On rocky shores where waves embrace,

    Two sea lions find their quiet place.

    With
    eyes that gleam beneath the sky,

    They share a love that will not die.'
  - 'Our love will prevail

    No distance can stop our love,

    I love you, my
    seal.'
  - 'Through the waves I send my love to you,

    Your beauty, power and grace flow
    back to me,

    You have caught my heart,

    It is yours to keep

'
  - 'They swim through waves, so free, so true,

    In the endless blue, just me
    and you.

    Their love, like the sea, wild and deep,

    A bond so strong,
    it will never sleep.

'
  - 'The ocean hums a song so sweet,

    A melody where hearts can meet.

    Its
    waves caress, then fade away,

    Like love that lingers, then will sway.

'
  - "Bubbles kiss the sky,\r\nLove blooms in each fleeting rise,\r\nPop\u2014then
    hearts will fly."
  - 'Bubbles softly rise,

    Carrying whispers of love,

    Burst in tender light.'
  - 'Bubbles softly rise,

    Carrying whispers of love,

    Burst in tender light.'
  - "True love is the greatest thing in the world, \nexcept for a nice MLT, \nmutton,
    lettuce and tomato sandwich when \nthe mutton is nice and lean, and the tomato
    is ripe"
  - "Mawage. Mawage is wot bwings us together today.\nMawage, that blessed awangement,
    that dweam \nwifin a dweam. And wuv, tru wuv, will fowow you \nfoweva. So tweasure
    your wuv."
